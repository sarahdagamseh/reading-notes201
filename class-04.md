## *Adding Images*
## < img>
### *To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

**src**
### This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images.

**alt**
### This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

**title**
### You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

## *Height & Width of Images*
### *height*
### This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

### *width*
### This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## *Foreground Color*

### *hex codes*
### These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color,preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80.

## *Understanding Color*

### - RGB Values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
### *for example:* rgb(102,205,170)

### - Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue.
### *for example:* #66cdaa

### - Color Names:Colors are represented by predefined names. However,  they are very limited in number.
### *for example:* MediumAquaMarine

### - Hue:Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

### - Saturation:Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

### - Brightness:Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

# Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

### *Building Blocks*
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### *Containing Elements*
### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

# Controll ing the Position of Elements

### ***positioning schemes*** that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### - Normal flow
### - Relative Positioning
### - Ab solute positioning


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
### **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a pecific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

### - *calling* If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task.
### - *parameters* Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. For example, a function to calculate the area of a box would need to know its width and height.

### - *return value* When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer.
