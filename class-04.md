# Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

### *Building Blocks*
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### *Containing Elements*
### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

# Controll ing the Position of Elements

### ***positioning schemes*** that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### - Normal flow
### - Relative Positioning
### - Ab solute positioning


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
### **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a pecific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

### - *calling* If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task.
### - *parameters* Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. For example, a function to calculate the area of a box would need to know its width and height.

### - *return value* When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer.
